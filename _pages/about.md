I'm a Bioinformatics PhD student at the AmsterdamUMC Cancer Center.

In the past, I developed [CNP-ALIGN](https://github.com/timmocking/cnp-align), a Python tool which enables assessment of clonal relationships between different tumors from the same patient based on copy number profiles.

Currently, my work focuses on computational analysis of myeloid malignancies. I spend most of my time researching computational assessment of measurable residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia. I'm also interested in flow cytometry bioinformatics, in particular in the context of large and heterogeneous patient cohorts.
