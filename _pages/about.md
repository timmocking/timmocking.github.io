My research encompasses a range of topics within hematology. In my current role as a PhD student at Amsterdam UMC, I primarily focus on developing computational methods for measuring residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia.

I'm also involved in the development of computational tools to support researchers in translational medical research.  

If you'd like to discuss potentially working together, please feel free to get in touch!



## Research interests

### Measurable residual disease

My primary PhD project focused on identifying measurable residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia.

### Flow cytometry bioinformatics

The increasing size and dimensionality of flow cytometry datasets require innovative bioinformatics analyses.
